<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Problem Statement: Parental involvement is crucial in a child's educational journey, significantly impacting their academic success and overall development. However, many parents struggle to stay informed about their childrenâ€™s academic progress due to limited communication channels and lack of real-time updates. This disconnect reduces the potential for timely parental guidance and support, leading to missed opportunities for improvement. 

Objectives: The primary objective of this project is to develop a web-based platform that enhances communication between parents, teachers, and students, enabling tracking of academic progress and course management. The platform aims to: 

1. Empower parents with comprehensive progress reports and performance metrics. 
2. Assist teachers in efficiently managing courses and student assessments. 
3. Support students in organizing their coursework and staying on top of academic tasks.
